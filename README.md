java awt paint

#Instruction#

First you must have basic understanding of java awt.
In this program you all need to maintain co-ordinates of all oval and arc and so on.
we use thread.sleep(); method for slow movement of an item.
I use repaint();
for continue looping
if you wish to do it once then ignore it.
